# Blaze Buster — Spring-Powered Emergency Toy

ENGG*2100 Engineering Design Project

The Blaze Buster is a compact, spring-powered emergency response toy designed to fit entirely inside a Kinder™ Surprise capsule while demonstrating elastic potential energy → kinetic energy through play.

## Overview

* Theme: Emergency Services

* Target Age: 5+

* Mechanism: Spring-powered projectile launcher

* Design Tool: SolidWorks

* Manufacturing: 3D-printed prototype

* Assembly: Snap-fit, tool-free, no glue or adhesives involved

## Key Constraints

* Fits inside a 10 cm Kinder™ Surprise capsule when disassembled

* No tools, adhesives, or pre-made parts

* ≥75% 3D-printed components

* Projectile range ≥2.5 m

* Child-safe and repeatable operation

All constraints were met.

## Design Highlights

* Spring-powered water cannon (≈42% spring compression)

* Adjustable launch angles (15°, 30°, 45°, 60°)

* Modular snap-fit components

* Oversized wheels for enhanced play value

* Fully collapsible for capsule storage

## Results

✔ Projectile range exceeded 2.5 m

✔ Reliable, safe repeated use

✔ Meets all ENGG*2100 requirements
